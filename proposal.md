## Software: *libCEED*

*libCEED is a mathematical software library for high-order finite element method, designed for performance portability, run-time flexibility, and clean embedding in higher level libraries and applications. libCEED's approach is mainly algebraic, hence applicable to other discretization methods as well. libCEED's primary audience is engineers/scientist who want to run their experiments on different computational device types (CPUs, GPUs, etc.) without worrying about the device-specific implementations and those who want to benefit from high-order methods without losing performance drastically.*
